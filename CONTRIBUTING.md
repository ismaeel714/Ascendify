# Contributing

## How to contribute
1. Check existing Issues, especially `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted`.
2. Create a feature branch: `feat/<short-scope>`.
3. Write clear commits and a small PR with context and screenshots where relevant.

## Style
- Keep PRs under ~300 lines when possible.
- Add/update docs for any user-facing change.
